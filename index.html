    <p>
      I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.
      I'm interested in the application of these topics to financial analytics. On campus,
      I'm involved in CodeBase, a technical consulting club, and Zahanat, a Bollywood
      fusion dance team. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing/listening to music,
      and trying new foods.
