<p>
  I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm
  interested in the application of these topics to financial analytics. On campus,
  I'm involved in CodeBase, a technical consulting club, and Zahanat, a Bollywood
  fusion dance team. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing/listening to music,
  and trying new foods.
